Finally I can say that this is the first stable release of Ambxst! {{ dmoji(name="oldsmiley") }}

After months of development and countless iterations, I'm excited to share version 1.0.0 with you all. This release marks a significant milestone in the journey of creating an ***Ax**tremely* customizable shell.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting from this version, Ambxst will no longer be located in `$HOME` and will be moved to `~/.local/src/ambxst`.
>> [!NOTE]
>>This does not affect NixOS users.
>
> Configuration, data, and state directories will be changed to lowercase: `~/.config/ambxst`, `~/.local/share/ambxst`, and `~/.local/state/ambxst` respectively.
>
> Part of `~/.local/share/Ambxst` will be relocated to `~/.cache/ambxst`.
>
> Presets may break in terms of appearance due to the major changes in this version. Default presets will remain outdated until 1.0.1.
>
> The main namespace has been set to `ambxst`. Subcomponents have been set to `ambxst:*`.

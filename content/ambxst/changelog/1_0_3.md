I'm still trying to figure out how to optimize this thing. But for now I'll push this version to at least fix the updater.

#### Changes

- Disable shaders on flat color for better performance
- Optimize metrics
- Restore floating dock option
- Enhance migration process
- Remove wifi/bt revealers (temporary change)
- Update version and wallpapers

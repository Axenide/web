Finally I can say that this is the first stable release of Ambxst! After months of development and countless iterations, I'm excited to share version 1.0.0 with you all. This release marks a significant milestone in the journey of creating an ***Ax**tremely* customizable shell.

#### Features
- **Player Redesign:** Introduced a new media player featuring wavy shaders and smooth inertia animations.
- **Frame Element:** Introduced the `Frame` element as an aesthetic option for UI containment.
- **Global Settings Search:** Implemented deep search functionality within the Settings window.
- **Enhanced Generators:** Added new theme generators for Discord, Kitty, and NvChad.
- **Extended Theming:** New color schemes including GitHub, Kanagawa, Paradise, and more.
- **Wallpaper Tinting:** Integrated wallpaper tinting shaders to harmonize with the active palette.

#### Improvements
- **Unified Shell:** Migrated to a single `PanelWindow` architecture for optimized resource usage.
- **Standalone Settings:** Migrated settings to a separate window to declutter the main shell.
- **Emoji System:** Overhauled the emoji picker with a fresh design and improved highlights.
- **Layout Flexibility:** Added support for top/bottom notch positioning and refined fullscreen behavior.
- **Popup Logic:** Refined popup offsets to correctly account for screen frame thickness.

#### Fixes
- Resolved stability issues and crashes during system suspend/sleep.
- Fixed bar positioning, shadow rendering, and masking artifacts.
- Fixed vertical bar centering issues.
- Corrected IPC concurrency during lockscreen calls and application launch paths.
- Fixed notification timeouts and calendar navigation buttons.
